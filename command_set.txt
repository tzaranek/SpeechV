Between applications: alt-tab

Holding a key
    - Sometimes it's necessary to continously 'hold' a key down
        - e.g. alt-tab while holding alt will show the available apps and pan
          through them on successive 'tab's
    - represent through hold/release combination
        - 'hold alt tab' ... 'tab' .... 'tab tab' .... 'escape'
    - hold must be followed by a 'meta' key like alt, control, shift
    - any number of these will be concurrently 'held'
    - to hold a meta, must prefix command with 'hold' keyword
    - 'release' releases all meta keys being held

Text entry
----------
Meta enter a word: meta <word>
    - the first word after meta is recognized
    - e.g.:
        - 'meta meta modes' will put 'meta modes' in text field
