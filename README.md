# SpeechV

SpeechV serves as an interface between the user and existing computer applications. Specifically, SpeechV enables users to do research online and compose documents using only their voice. It is designed to work with Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Word in a Windows environment.

## Installation

1. Install Firefox, Python3 and npm

2. Open Administrator command prompt (SpeechV must be run on windows 10 with administrator privileges)

3. Goto SpeechV directory

4. Run `python config.py`

5. Restart command prompt

6. Goto SpeechV/extension directory

7. Run `npm install`

8. Run `npm install -g web-ext`

9. Run `npm start`

## How to start SpeechV

1. Open a command prompt to load the extension

2. Goto SpeechV/extension directory

3. Run `web-ext run`. This starts a special firefox, which will start up SpeechV

## Tutorial: Using SpeechV for common tasks

These are instructions on how specific actions can be done in SpeechV. For a complete list of actions, see below.

### Navigating the web

1. Execute a Google search    
`Search puppies`

2. Open the images tab  
`Follow` to populate the screen with labels corresponding to links and input fields. Give the corresponding label for the images tab.

3. Scrolling    
`Down` for more puppies!

4. Working with multiple tabs    
`New tab` to search for kittens!    
`Previous tab` to go back to the puppies.

### Editing word documents

1. Inserting text    
```
Insert
Puppies
New paragraph
Puppies are cute period
```
SpeechV replaces phrases that end with 'period' or 'comma' with the corresponding punctuation. New lines and line breaks are also supported.   
`Navigate` to end text insertion

2. Moving your cursor around    
Use `up/down/left/right` to move your cursor around the document.

3. Punctuation, indentation and formatting    
You can also insert punctuation as necessary, such as `exclamation` and `open parenthesis`.    
Adjust alignment using `center/left/right align`.

4. Formatting regions of text   
To delete, bold or format regions of text, use `highlight` to enter the highlighting mode. When in highlight, `up/down/left/right` expands the selected region of text. `Bold/italics/underline` formats the selected region as desired.

5. Advanced formatting   
SpeechV allows you to access the toolbar in Microsoft Word using the command `follow`.    
For example, to make a bulleted list:
```
Follow
H
U
Cancel
```    
Every follow must end with a cancel! This is a known limitation that we are currently working on.

**Record start**: Begin recording a macro   
    - **<label>** Between these two commands, any commands issued will be recorded  
**Record end**: Finish recording a macro    
    - **<label>** After ending a recording, a prompt to name the macro and a confirmation prompt will appear to complete the process.   

### Adjusting microphone settings
If speech recognition is not performing well, you are likely experiencing one of two problems:   
1. SpeechV cuts you off while you're still speaking     
2. SpeechV processes cannot recognize your voice or processes audio when you're not speaking

Problem one can be fixed by accessing the **settings** panel. From there, increase the voice timeout setting. This is the amount of silence that signals the end of a command. Increasing audio timeout allows for longer pauses when speaking, but slows down overall performance. 

Problem two is likely an issue with your environment. SpeechV tries to automatically detect and adjust for ambient noise, but consider using SpeechV in a quiet environment for optimal performance.
