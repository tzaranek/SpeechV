## How to use SpeechV

SpeechV recognizes voice commands and translates them to actions executed by your computer. SpeechV can execute a few types of actions: keyboard shortcuts, Windows actions, browser actions and Microsoft Word actions. In addition, you can create custom commands (macros) as well as aliases for existing commands to suit your needs. The microphone can also be adjusted for your individual speech patterns.

Instructions on how to use SpeechV can be accessed when you are using the application via the **help** command.

### Microsoft Word actions
Commands for Microsoft Word are broken up into three categories: Navigate, Highlight, and Insert. To enter each mode, simply say its name, allowing access to that categories' command set until another mode is switched to.
### Navigate: Allows navigation around the document 
**Up <number>**: Moves the cursor up one line, or a number of lines if followed by an optional number argument  
**Down <number>**: Moves the cursor down one line, or a number of lines if followed by an optional number argument  
**Left <number>**: Moves the cursor left one word, or a number of words if followed by an optional number argument  
**Right <number>**: Moves the cursor right one word, or a number of words if followed by an optional number argument     
**Paragraph up**: Moves the cursor up one paragraph     
**Paragraph down**: Moves the cursor down one paragraph     
**Page up**: Moves the cursor up one page       
**Page down**: Moves the cursor down one page       
**Period**: Enters a period at the cursor's position        
    - **<label>** Replacing period with any of the following will enter the corresponding symbol: comma, exclamation, question, slash, colon, semicolon, apostrophe, quote, open parenthesis, close parenthesis, ampersand, dollar, star    
    
**Left/Right/Center align**: Align the text at your cursor      
**Undo**: Undoes the previous text entry        
**Re do**: Redoes an undone text entry      
**Indent**: Indents at the cursor position

### Highlight: Allows highlighting of text while navigating
**Down <number>**: Moves the cursor and highlights down one line, or a number of lines if followed by an optional number argument   
**Up <number>**: Moves the cursor up and highlights one line, or a number of lines if followed by an optional number argument   
**Right <number>**: Moves the cursor right and highlights one word, or a number of words if followed by an optional number argument

### Insert: Allows insertion of voice commands to text within the document
Use your voice to enter in text. Ending a voice sample with "period" will end your sentence with a period and begin to format your next sentence.


### Creating macros and aliases
**Record start**: Begin recording a macro   
    - **<label>** Between these two commands, any commands issued will be recorded  
**Record end**: Finish recording a macro    
    - **<label>** After ending a recording, a prompt to name the macro and a confirmation prompt will appear to complete the process.   

### Adjusting microphone settings
If speech recognition is not performing well, you are likely experiencing one of two problems:   
1. SpeechV cuts you off while you're still speaking     
2. SpeechV processes cannot recognize your voice or processes audio when you're not speaking

Problem one can be fixed by accessing the **settings** panel. From there, increase the voice timeout setting. This is the amount of silence that signals the end of a command. Increasing audio timeout allows for longer pauses when speaking, but slows down overall performance. 

Problem two is likely an issue with your environment. SpeechV tries to automatically detect and adjust for ambient noise, but consider using SpeechV in a quiet environment for optimal performance.
