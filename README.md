## How to use SpeechV

SpeechV recognizes voice commands and translates them to actions executed by your computer. SpeechV can execute a few types of actions: keyboard shortcuts, Windows actions, browser actions and Microsoft Word actions. In addition, you can create custom commands (macros) as well as aliases for existing commands to suit your needs. The microphone can also be adjusted for your individual speech patterns.

Instructions on how to use SpeechV can be accessed when you are using the application via the **help** command.

### Keyboard shortcuts

You can execute a keyboard shortcut in SpeechV by simply saying the names of the keys to be pressed. Most keyboard shortcuts require the control, shift or alt key to be held. To do this, you say **hold** followed by the key to be held, the names of the other keys, followed by **escape** to release all held keys. Multiple keys can be held at the same time.

For example, to switch between applications, say **hold alt** followed by **tab** (as many times as necessary) then **escape**. To go to the security screen, say **hold control hold alt delete escape**.

### Windows actions

Besides the functionality afforded by the keyboard shortcuts, actions such as resizing and moving windows can be executed using SpeechV.

**Resize left/right**: Move current app into the left/right half of the screen
**Resize up/down**: Move current app into top/bottom half of the screen
**Resize file**: Make current app fullscreen

### Browser actions

SpeechV supports navigating 
web pages by finding and labelling all links/input fields on the page. You can then select an input field or follow a link using the label. Commands for viewing web pages, opening tabs and other browser functions are supported.

### Adjusting microphone settings (coming soon)
If speech recognition is not performing well, you are likely experiencing one of two problems:   
1. SpeechV cuts you off while you're still speaking   
2. SpeechV can't hear you or processes commands when you're not speaking

These can be fixed by accessing the **settings** panel.

To address problem 1, increase the audio timeout setting. This is the amount of silence that signals the end of a command. Increasing audio timeout allows for longer pauses when speaking, but slows down overall performance. 

To address problem 2, recalibrate the microphone. SpeechV will listen to your surroundings and automatically adjust to distinguish background noise from voice input.
