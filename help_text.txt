General commands
-----------------

SpeechV recognizes keyboard shortcuts input via voice commands.
SpeechV also supports some common commands for basic operation.

Entering keyboard shortcuts:
    To hold a key, "hold" followed by the key to be held (alt, control, shift). Any number of keys can be concurrently held.
    To release all held keys, "escape".

    Examples:
    - To switch between applications: "hold alt tab" "tab" ... "escape"
    - To launch security screen: "hold control hold alt delete escape"

Resizing windows:
    "Resize left/right": Move current app into the left/right half of the screen
    "Resize up/down": Move current app into top/bottom half of the screen
    "Resize file": Make current app fullscreen

Troubleshooting
----------------

SpeechV cuts you off while you're still speaking:
    In Settings, increase the audio timeout. This is the amount of silence that marks the end of a command.
    Higher audio timeout allows for longer pauses in the middle of a command, but slows down overall performance.

SpeechV can't hear you or processes commands when you're not speaking:
    In Settings, recalibrate the microphone. SpeechV will listen to your surroundings and adjust appropriately to distinguish background noise from voice input.
