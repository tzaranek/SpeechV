SpeechV Help
=============

SpeechV is a means to computer navigation through voice alone. SpeechV enables navigation through commands in the form of short phrases. These short phrases must exactly match a predefined set of phrases which enable switching between applications, clickling on links, and so on. This document outlines the most fundamental commands, while the browser help window elaborates on firefox navigation. 

General commands
-----------------
"Help close": Close any help window that's open, including this one
"Help browser": Display help for navigating with Firefox. This help window must first be closed
"Switch <application>": Switch focus onto application with name <application> [TODO: beta]
"Launch <application>": Start up application with name <application> [TODO: beta]

Resizing windows
-----------------
"Resize left/right": Move current app into the left/right half of the screen
"Resize up/down": Move current app into top/bottom half of the screen
"Resize file": Make current app fullscreen

Holding Keys
-------------
"Hold <modifier key>": Simulates holding down a modifier key (i.e. "alt", "control", "shift", etc.). Any number of keys can be simultaneously held
"Escape": Releases all held keys

    Examples:
    - To switch between applications: "hold alt tab" "tab" ... "escape"
    - To launch security screen: "hold control hold alt delete escape"


Troubleshooting
----------------
Q: Why is SpeechV cutting me off while I'm in the middle of speaking?
A: SpeechV appears to be overly sensitive of the pauses in your speech. You'll need to adust this in the settings
   by increasing the audio timeout. A higher audio timeout will tell SpeechV to wait longer before
   recognizing a pause in speech. Note that increasing the audio timeout will slow down overall 
   performance, since it will wait longer before execution

Q: Why can't SpeechV hear me? Why is SpeechV hearing unspoken commands?
A: These are both symptoms of a miscalibrated microphone. You'll need to recalibrate the microphone 
   in the Windows settings such that it can appropriately distinguish background noise from voice input.
