Troubleshooting
----------------

SpeechV cuts you off while you're still speaking:
    In Settings, increase the audio timeout. This is the amount of silence that marks the end of a command. Higher audio timeout allows for longer pauses in the middle of a command, but slows down overall performance.

SpeechV can't hear you or processes commands when you're not speaking:
    In Settings, recalibrate the microphone. SpeechV will listen to your surroundings and adjust appropriately to distinguish background noise from voice input.
